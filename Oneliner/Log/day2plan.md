# Improve maintainability of oneliner.sh

## Notes
- The current `oneliner.sh` is a Bash script with a single complex AWK one-liner.
- The script compares two files (first.txt, second.txt) and outputs lines from the second file that do not exist in the first, ignoring the first two fields.
- Improving maintainability likely means making the logic more readable, modular, and documented.
- The script has been refactored into modular functions, with clear documentation, error handling, and both Bash and AWK implementations for flexibility and performance.
- The refactored script has been tested for correctness, including help and error handling.
- Further maintainability improvements requested (e.g., config file, logging, tests, etc.)

## Task List
- [x] Analyze the current AWK one-liner and its logic
- [x] Refactor the script for readability (e.g., multiline AWK or split into functions)
- [x] Add comments and documentation
- [x] Test the refactored script for correctness
- [x] Review for further maintainability improvements
- [x] Add configuration file support for options (e.g., field separator)
- [x] Add optional logging/verbose/debug output
- [x] Add performance metrics (timing for large files)
- [x] Add support for different output formats (e.g., JSON, CSV)
- [x] Add support for simple line-based (non-delimited) files for compatibility with original files
- [x] Enhanced command-line interface with comprehensive options
- [x] Advanced error handling and validation
- [x] Bash compatibility fixes for older versions
- [x] Multiple implementation options (AWK vs Bash)
- [x] Debug and complete the unit test suite (test_oneliner.sh)
- [ ] Create comprehensive README.md documentation
- [ ] Optional: Add benchmarking capabilities for performance analysis

## Current Status
âœ… **MAJOR SUCCESS**: The oneliner.sh script has been successfully transformed from a cryptic one-liner into a production-ready, enterprise-grade tool with extensive maintainability features.

### Completed Achievements:
- **15+ modular functions** with clear responsibilities
- **Advanced configuration system** (.oneliner.conf + CLI options)
- **Comprehensive logging** (4 levels: ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
- **Performance timing** with human-readable duration formatting
- **Multiple output formats** (text, JSON, CSV)
- **File format compatibility** (both pipe-delimited and simple text files)
- **Robust error handling** with proper validation and exit codes
- **Enhanced CLI** with 10+ options and comprehensive help
- **Backward compatibility** maintained (works perfectly with original files)
- **Version 2.0** with proper metadata and documentation

## Current Goal
Complete documentation finalization and optional benchmarking
