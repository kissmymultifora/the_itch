# Refactor wordle.sh for Maintainability

## Notes
- User requested to refactor wordle.sh to improve maintainability.
- The script is a Bash implementation of Wordle, currently monolithic and procedural.
- The code has repeated logic for output formatting and word validation.
- Identified main functional blocks and refactored script into modular functions with improved variable naming and comments.
- All automated tests now use proper 5-letter words for validation.
- User requested further improvements to make the script even more maintainable.

## Task List

- [x] Modularize code into functions for each responsibility
- [x] Replace repeated logic with reusable functions
- [x] Add comments and improve variable naming for clarity
- [x] Test refactored script for correctness
- [ ] Analyze script for further maintainability improvements
